I am currently looking for a Master's program in Chemistry. I am particularly interested in computation and instrumentation heavy areas. Sometimes university
websites group their faculty by area of research. This is not the case for McGill, where I am presented but a list with names and therefore have
to go through everyone's profiles to see weather their research corresponds with my interests.

This program gives me a way to see which professors I might be interested to work with at a glance. It goes through every faculty's research page and 
extracts information about their research. The program then summarizes the text presented on their page and puts all the information in a .csv file.

The final product is a short and simple Excel file that I can scroll through and immediately identify which faculty members I might be interested to work 
for based on their research tldr.
